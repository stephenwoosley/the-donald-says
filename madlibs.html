    <h1>The Donald Says</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>On Health Care</h2>
    <p>"You have to be hit by a <span id="reallyFastObject1"></span>, literally, a <span id="reallyFastObject2"></span>, to use it, because the <span id="wallStreetNoun1"></span> are so high. It's virtually useless. And remember the $5 billion <span id="techProduct1"></span>s?... I have so many <span id="techProduct2"></span>s, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a <span id="techProduct3"></span>. It costs me $3."</p>
    <br>
    <h2>On Foreign Policy</h2>
    <p>"I just sold a <span id="techProduct4"></span> for <span id="ridiculousDollarAmount"></span> to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them?... I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower.</p>
    <p>"Their <span id="randomNoun1"></span> are much smarter than our <span id="randomNoun2"></span>, and we can't sustain ourselves with that. It's like - take the <span id="professionalTeam"></span> and <span id="bestPlayer"></span> and have them play your high school <span id="sport"></span> team. That's the difference between China's <span id="randomNoun3"></span> and our <span id="randomNoun4"></span>."</p>
    <br>
    <h2>On Campaign Finance</h2>
    <p>"I don't need anybody's <span id="wallStreetNoun2"></span>. It's nice. I don't need anybody's <span id="wallStreetNoun3"></span>. I'm using my own <span id="wallStreetNoun4"></span>. I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors. I don't care. I'm really <span id="foodAdjective"></span>, I'll show you that in a second. And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a braggadocios ... that's the kind of thinking you need for this country."</p>
